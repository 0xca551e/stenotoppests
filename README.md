# StenoToppests

StenoToppests are a set of custom 3D printed keycaps which convert a mechanical keyboard into a stenotype look-alike.

StenoToppests are based on [StenoToppers](https://github.com/CemraJC/stenotoppers), but with the few changes:

- The stem holders on the original StenoToppers will snap off if printing in more brittle filaments. StenoToppests has a different keycap stem holder design that can allow using more brittle filaments.
- Can fit "dust-proof" type switches that have walls around the stem.
